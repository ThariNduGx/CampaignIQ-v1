1. What kind of data are you trying to analyze or visualize?
The application will analyze and visualize key performance data from two primary sources: Google (specifically Google Ads & Analytics) and Meta (Facebook & Instagram Ads).

The specific metrics we need to see for our campaigns are:

Impressions

Clicks

Ad Spend (or Cost)

Conversions (e.g., purchases, sign-ups)

Conversion Value (Revenue)

Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Cost Per Click (CPC)

Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

Return On Ad Spend (ROAS)

The main goal is to pull all this data together to see a unified view of performance instead of logging into each platform separately.

2. What specific insights should users get from their connected accounts?
Users should be able to answer critical business questions quickly and easily:

Holistic Performance: "What is my total ad spend and total revenue across all my platforms for this month?" The app should show combined totals.

Cross-Platform Effectiveness: "Which platform is performing better for my 'Summer Sale' campaign? Is Google or Facebook giving me a lower Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)?" Users need to see side-by-side comparisons.

Performance Over Time: "Is my Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) getting better or worse over the last 90 days?" This requires trend-line charts.

AI-Powered Summaries: This is a key feature. Instead of just showing numbers, the app should use the OpenAI API to provide plain-English insights like: "This week, your overall ROAS increased by 15%, driven by strong performance on Facebook Ads which saw a 30% decrease in CPA."

Anomaly Detection: The AI should also be able to spot problems, for example: "Alert: The cost for your Google Ads campaign 'Brand Search' spiked by 80% yesterday with no increase in clicks."

3. What would be the main user workflow?
The user journey should be as simple as possible:

Sign Up / Log In: A user creates a secure account with their email and password.

Connect Platforms: The very first thing the user does is navigate to a 'Settings' or 'Connections' page. Here, they will see buttons to "Connect Google" and "Connect Facebook." They will go through a standard, secure OAuth pop-up window to grant the app permission to view their ad data. This is a one-time setup.

View the Dashboard: Once accounts are connected, the main dashboard becomes their central hub. It automatically shows their combined data. They will see summary cards at the top, charts showing trends, and a table with detailed campaign data.

Interact and Analyze: The user can select a date range (e.g., "Last 30 Days") to update all the visuals on the dashboard. They can look at the charts to compare performance across platforms.

Get AI Insights: The user clicks a button like "Generate AI Summary" on the dashboard. The app then displays a simple, text-based summary and any critical alerts about their campaign performance.

In summary, please ensure the application you build includes secure user authentication, OAuth connections for Google and Facebook, data visualization with charts, and the OpenAI integration for insights. I look forward to seeing how you build this using Replit's powerful and compatible technologies.
